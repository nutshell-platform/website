# How to use Nutshell
For the people new to Nutshell, or people who are just interested in how _we_ feel you should use the app, we have this page!

## First impressions
When you open the Nutshell app, you're automatically directed to your _Unread Nutshell_ feed.
This feed shows you the Nutshells your friends have posted recently and you haven't read yet.
Feel free to browse and catch up on what your friends have been up to!
If you've read one of your friends' Nutshells and don't need to see it again, you can mark it as read by clicking the _Mark as read_ button.

If all you see is the _You're all caught up_ card, this means that there are no more new Nutshells for you to read!
This card also shows up if you're new to Nutshell, and no new Nutshells have been posted yet since signing up.

## The Nutshell app
When opening the Nutshell app, you'll see a number of elements in the user interface.
To help you click what you want to click, we're going to explain just _what_ does _what_ in the app!

### The top bar
At the top of your screen, you will find the aptly named _top bar_, which displays a number of icons, as well as the page you're currently viewing.

#### Current page
On the left end of the top bar, the page you are currently on is displayed.
When opening the app, this will be the _Home_ page.

#### Go back home
Clicking the little house icon will make you go back to _Home_, aka your _Unread Nutshell_ feed.
If you don't know what's going on anymore, you can always click this and you'll be back where you started!

#### Add friends
The person icon with the plus next to it takes you to the place where you can find people to follow.
It will take you to a list of _all_ Nutshell users, where you can search for specific people by handle or email.

Start building your network!

#### Write your Nutshell
The pencil icon, just left of the three bars, takes you to the _Nutshell drafting_ page, where you can write and edit your own Nutshell.

If you've got anything to share with your friends, get writing!

#### Open the sidebar
The final icon on the top bar is a set of three bars over one another.
When you click this, you'll open the sidebar, where you can find so many things!

### The sidebar
The sidebar is a collapsible menu visible in the Nutshell app.

You can open the sidebar by clicking the three-bar icon in the top bar.

#### Menu
You can't do anything with this.
All it tells you is that you've opened the menu!

#### Profile
Clicking this takes you to your own Nutshell profile.
Here, you can see who you are, your followers, and the Nutshells you've posted.

#### Friends
This button takes you to the _friend finder_ page, where you can find people to follow.
It will take you to a list of _all_ Nutshell users, where you can search for specific people by handle or email.

Start building your network!

#### Settings
If you want to change something, this is the button to click.
It takes you to the _settings_ page, where you can do stuff!

#### Logout
Clicking this makes you log out of the Nutshell app.

Why would you do this?

We don't know.

You could, though.

#### Version number
Almost at the bottom of the sidebar, you can find a series or seemingly random numbers and letters which don't really mean anything to you.
If you click it, however, you will force the app to check for an updated version, and if that is found you will be asked to run the update!

#### Dark mode
All the way at the bottom of the sidebar is a slider that can enable or disable the dark mode in the app.
Enabling dark mode makes the app dark, _duh_, making things easier on the eyes in darker environments

Click the slider and pretend you're Batman!

### The action bullet
In the bottom right corner of the app there's a small circle with a plus sign in it.
Clicking this will open the action bullet, giving you things to do!

#### Write Nutshell
This button takes you to the _Nutshell drafting_ page, where you can write and edit your own Nutshell.

If you've got anything to share with your friends, get writing!

#### Add friends
This button takes you to the _friend finder_ page, where you can find people to follow.
It will take you to a list of _all_ Nutshell users, where you can search for specific people by handle or email.

Start building your network!

## Writing your own Nutshell
When something has been going on in your life that you'd love to share with your friends, you can write your own Nutshell!

### How to get there
As it's one of the most important things in the app, there are two ways to get to the _Nutshell drafting_ page.
You could either click the pencil icon in the top bar, or open the action bubble and click the _Write Nutshell_ icon!
From the _Nutshell feed_, you can also click the _Draft & schedule your Nutshell_ button on the _You're all caught up_ card.

### Auto-publish
One of the first things you can do anything with it the _scheduling_ slider.
When the slider is to the right, your Nutshell is set to publish on the next release!
When the slider is to the left, you're not going to update your friends about your life for a little while.

### Nutshelling
The second card in the _Nutshell drafting_ page is the first entry for your coming Nutshell!
Nutshell entries consist of a short and catchy title, followed by a longer message explaining what you've been up to.

### Nutshell sorting
If you've accidentally messed up which Nutshell goes where, for instance when some things that should go together are split by something that happened in between, you can sort your Nutshells into a more logical order!
The arrows at the top of the card are what makes this tick.
When you click the up arrow, the card it's in will move one place up, and when you click the down arrow, the card will move one place down.
Makes sense, no?

## Viewing your profile
If you want to see what you yourself have been up to, you can view your own profile by clicking the _Profile_ button in the sidebar.
In the profile view, you can see your profile picture, your name, your bio, and your number of followers.
Below this first card will be your Nutshells, sorted by date.

## Adding friends
To find people to follow, you need to get to the _friend finder_ page.
Click the person icon with the plus, or expand the action bubble and click the _Add friends_ button to go to where you want to go.

The _friend finder_ page shows you all the people that are on Nutshell, and you can find new people either by scrolling through this, or by searching for them by handle or email.

## Managing your friends
The friends you already have can be viewed and managed by clicking the _Friends_ tab in the sidebar.
This page gives you an overview of all the people you're following, and you can decide to unfollow them here.

## Updating your profile
If you want to update your profile, be it your profile picture, your name, your handle, or your bio, you need to go to the _Settings_ tab in the sidebar.
Here, you'll find a card welcoming you, and you'll also be able to change all the things we've just mentioned.

## Changing your password
You password can be changed by going to the _Settings_ tab from the sidebar, and scrolling down to the _Account settings_ card.
Here, you can set a new password by filling in the field just below your email address.
It even says _new password_!

When typing into this field, a new field will appear where you'll have to verify this new password.
Just so you don't ruin your password forever.

## Changing your notification preferences
Your notification preferences can be updated by going to the _Settings_ tab from the sidebar, and scrolling down to the _Account settings_ card.
At the bottom, you can find the _Notification preferences_, where you can individually enable or disable notifications.

Interested in what the notifications mean exactly?
Click the information icon next to the slider!
